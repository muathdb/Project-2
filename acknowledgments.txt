Acknowledgments


I used the Python standard scientific computing stack for this project, including:
- NumPy: for numerical computation, linear algebra, simulation, and resampling.
- pandas: for tabular data handling and saving TSV output files.


I did not discuss this assignment with other students or individuals.


Generative AI:
I used OpenAI’s ChatGPT to help with some coding error to better understanding what was wrong with my codes.


No other outside sources or libraries were used.
